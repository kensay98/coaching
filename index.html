                <ul class="audience-list">
                    <li>A <strong>founder</strong> dealing with the loneliness and the weight of decisions nobody else can make</li>

                    <li>Someone struggling with <strong>people stuff</strong>: managing, conflict, communicating with stakeholders who don't think like you</li>
                    <li>Someone stuck in <strong>patterns</strong> you can see but can't seem to stop</li>
                    <li>Someone dealing with <strong>imposter syndrome</strong>, self-doubt, the voice that says you don't belong</li>
                    <li>Someone making <strong>hard calls</strong> with incomplete information, wanting a thinking partner who doesn't have a stake in your decision</li>

            <div class="about-text">
                <p>I coach founders and leaders through the decisions, patterns, and loneliness that come with building something real.</p>
                <p>I know this territory from the inside. I co-founded YamFood in 2019 — bootstrapped with $20K, pivoted from B2C to B2B logistics when the market made that obvious. At Express24 (acquired by Yandex), I helped build a product that hit 100K monthly active users and $50M in annual revenue. Before that, I was a software engineer, product manager, and engineering manager. I've led teams through the mess of fast growth.</p>
                <p>I know what it's like. The 3am decisions. The patterns you can see but can't stop. The loneliness of being responsible for everything while having nobody you can be fully honest with.</p>
                <p>I've been coaching since 2024 and I'm finishing my ICF accreditation in 2026. My approach comes from formal coaching training, two 10-day Vipassana courses, and direct work with what actually helps people change.</p>
                <p>I'm also building Growy AI, a team alignment platform. I'm still in the startup world — not coaching from the outside.</p>

                    <p><strong>Inside, it's messier:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Decisions pile up because you can't think through them clearly, or you're scared of being wrong</li>
                        <li>The same patterns keep showing up in how you lead and how you react under stress — visible but unstoppable</li>
                        <li>You're performing "strong" when inside you feel like a fraud</li>
                        <li>You feel alone with the hard stuff — the fears, the doubts, the questions you can't ask anyone</li>
                        <li>You sense there's more, but you don't know how to get there</li>

                        <li><strong>Clarity.</strong> That decision you've been avoiding? You'll see it clearly, including your blind spots, and make a call you can stand behind.</li>
                        <li><strong>Different patterns.</strong> The behaviors that keep costing you — relationships, opportunities, sleep. You'll understand why they're there and find another way.</li>
                        <li><strong>Steadiness.</strong> The ability to stay calm when things are hard. Leading from who you are, not who you're performing to be.</li>
                        <li><strong>Not being alone.</strong> Someone who knows who you actually are, beyond the role, and holds that without judgment.</li>
                        <li><strong>Growth.</strong> Becoming the leader you need to be for what's next, without losing yourself.</li>

                    <p>They give you their answer, from their experience, with their biases. You can't be fully honest about fears or doubts — they're evaluating whether you're "leadership material."</p>
                    <p class="highlight"><strong>Coaching gives you your answer</strong> — uncovered through questions and challenge. An answer you own because it came from you.</p>

                    <h4>vs. Therapist</h4>
                    <p>Therapy takes you from "not okay" to "okay." Important work, and if that's what you need, do that.</p>
                    <p class="highlight"><strong>This is "okay" to "next level."</strong> You're already functioning. We're working on evolution, not repair.</p>

                    <h4>vs. Friends, Partner, Co-founder</h4>
                    <p>They're too close. They have stakes in your decisions. You can't say "I'm afraid I can't handle this" without consequences.</p>
                    <p class="highlight"><strong>I have zero stake in your decisions.</strong> Complete confidentiality. Nothing you say will be shared with anyone or used against you.</p>

                    <h4>vs. Other Coaches</h4>
                    <p>Many business coaches stay surface-level — tactics and frameworks. Many "transformational" coaches are abstract and slow.</p>
                    <p class="highlight"><strong>I integrate both.</strong> Depth modalities with the pragmatism of someone who's actually built things in tech.</p>

                    <p class="method-intro">We work with whatever you bring. Sometimes that's a concrete decision you need to make this week. Sometimes it goes deeper — into the patterns and beliefs underneath. I draw from several approaches to go wherever the session needs to go:</p>
                    <ul class="format-list">
                        <li><strong>ICF coaching fundamentals</strong> — listening, asking questions, creating space for you to think clearly and find your own answers</li>
                        <li><strong>Body awareness</strong> — patterns show up in your body before your mind catches up. Sometimes we need to go there.</li>
                        <li><strong>Parts work (IFS)</strong> — understanding the competing voices inside you instead of fighting them</li>
                        <li><strong>Vipassana</strong> — shapes how I show up: the ability to sit with discomfort without rushing to fix it</li>
                    </ul>

                            <p>60 minutes. Bring something real: a decision you're stuck on, a pattern you want to understand, a situation you're navigating. This isn't a pitch. It's actual coaching. You'll leave with clarity on whatever you bring, whether we continue or not.</p>

                            <h4>The work</h4>
                            <p>Each session, you bring what's on your mind. We go where it needs to go. Over time, things shift. Decisions get clearer. Old patterns loosen. You start showing up differently — not through willpower, but because something has actually changed.</p>
