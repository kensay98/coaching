            <p class="hero-sub">A space to go deep with someone who gets it. We work as partners — exploring what's really going on, running experiments, and finding what actually shifts things. No agenda, no advice. Just the kind of honest work that changes how you lead and live.</p>

            <div class="audience-content">
                <p>You're accomplished and capable. You don't need fixing — you want partnership. Someone to think with, experiment with, and go beneath the surface with. Because the next level isn't about working harder. It's about seeing clearer.</p>

                <h3>You might be:</h3>
                <ul class="audience-list">
                    <li>A <strong>founder</strong> dealing with the loneliness and the weight of decisions nobody else can make</li>
                    <li>A <strong>leader in transition</strong>, stepping into a bigger role or figuring out what's next</li>
                    <li>Someone struggling with <strong>people stuff</strong>: managing, conflict, communicating with stakeholders who don't think like you</li>
                    <li>Someone stuck in <strong>patterns</strong> you can see but can't seem to stop</li>
                    <li>Someone dealing with <strong>imposter syndrome</strong>, self-doubt, the voice that says you don't belong</li>
                    <li>Someone making <strong>hard calls</strong> with incomplete information, wanting a thinking partner who doesn't have a stake in your decision</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Not a fit if:</h3>
                <ul class="not-for-list">
                    <li>You're in crisis and need clinical support. That's what therapy is for.</li>
                    <li>You want someone to tell you what to do. Get a mentor or advisor.</li>
                    <li>You want quick fixes. This takes time.</li>

            <div class="about-text">
                <p>I believe the best coaching happens when two people go deep together — not as guru and client, but as partners. I bring curiosity, directness, and a willingness to sit in the uncomfortable places where real change lives.</p>
                <p>Every session is an experiment. We might work with a decision that's keeping you up at night, or go underneath it into the patterns and parts driving it. I follow what's alive, not a script.</p>
                <p>I come from the world I coach in. I co-founded a startup, built products at a company acquired by Yandex, and led teams through the chaos of fast growth. I know what it's like to carry the weight of decisions with nobody to be honest with.</p>
                <p>I've been coaching since 2024 and I'm completing my ICF accreditation in 2026. My approach draws on formal coaching training, somatic work, Internal Family Systems, and years of meditation and internal work. I'm also building ttune.ai — I'm still in the startup world, not coaching from the outside.</p>

                <div class="alternative">
                    <h4>vs. Mentor or Advisor</h4>
                    <p>They give you their answer, from their experience, with their biases. You can't be fully honest about fears or doubts — they're evaluating whether you're "leadership material."</p>
                    <p class="highlight"><strong>Coaching gives you your answer</strong> — uncovered through questions and challenge. An answer you own because it came from you.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="alternative">
                    <h4>vs. Therapist</h4>
                    <p>Therapy takes you from "not okay" to "okay." Important work, and if that's what you need, do that.</p>
                    <p class="highlight"><strong>This is "okay" to "next level."</strong> You're already functioning. We're working on evolution, not repair.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="alternative">
                    <h4>vs. Friends, Partner, Co-founder</h4>
                    <p>They're too close. They have stakes in your decisions. You can't say "I'm afraid I can't handle this" without consequences.</p>
                    <p class="highlight"><strong>I have zero stake in your decisions.</strong> Complete confidentiality. Nothing you say will be shared with anyone or used against you.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="alternative">
                    <h4>vs. Other Coaches</h4>
                    <p>Many business coaches stay surface-level — tactics and frameworks. Many "transformational" coaches are abstract and slow.</p>
                    <p class="highlight"><strong>I integrate both.</strong> Depth modalities with the pragmatism of someone who's actually built things in tech.</p>

                    <h3>How I Work</h3>
                    <p class="method-intro">We work with whatever you bring. Sometimes that's a concrete decision you need to make this week. Sometimes it goes deeper — into the patterns and beliefs underneath. I draw from several approaches to go wherever the session needs to go:</p>
                    <ul class="format-list">
                        <li><strong>ICF coaching fundamentals</strong> — listening, asking questions, creating space for you to think clearly and find your own answers</li>
                        <li><strong>Body awareness</strong> — patterns show up in your body before your mind catches up. Sometimes we need to go there.</li>
                        <li><strong>Parts work (IFS)</strong> — understanding the competing voices inside you instead of fighting them</li>
                        <li><strong>Meditation Practice</strong> — shapes how I show up: the ability to sit with discomfort without rushing to fix it</li>
                    </ul>

                            <p>60 minutes. Bring something real: a decision you're stuck on, a pattern you want to understand, a situation you're navigating. This isn't a pitch. It's actual coaching. You'll leave with clarity on whatever you bring, whether we continue or not.</p>

                            <p>Each session, you bring what's on your mind. We go where it needs to go. Over time, things shift. Decisions get clearer. Old patterns loosen. You start showing up differently — not through willpower, but because something has actually changed.</p>
