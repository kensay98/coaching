                <p data-i18n="about.p1">I believe the best coaching happens when two people go deep together — not as guru and client, but as partners. I bring curiosity, directness, and a willingness to sit in the uncomfortable places where real change lives.</p>
                <p data-i18n="about.p2">Every session is an experiment. We might work with a decision that's keeping you up at night, or go underneath it into the patterns and parts driving it. I follow what's alive, not a script.</p>
                <p data-i18n="about.p3">I come from the world I coach in. I co-founded a startup, built products at a company acquired by Yandex, and led teams through the chaos of fast growth. I know what it's like to carry the weight of decisions with nobody to be honest with.</p>
                <p data-i18n="about.p4">I've been coaching since 2024 and I'm completing my ICF accreditation in 2026. My approach draws on formal coaching training, somatic work, Internal Family Systems, and years of meditation and internal work. I'm also building ttune.ai — I'm still in the startup world, not coaching from the outside.</p>

                        <li data-i18n="how.method.2"><strong>Body awareness</strong> — patterns show up in your body before your mind catches up. Sometimes we need to go there.</li>
                        <li data-i18n="how.method.3"><strong>Parts work (IFS)</strong> — understanding the competing voices inside you instead of fighting them</li>

We've had a few sessions recently — and I really appreciated his ability to create space, ask the right questions, and help make sense of what's going on. No pressure, no clichés — just calm, thoughtful guidance. If you're navigating change or just need more clarity, definitely worth talking to him.</p>
