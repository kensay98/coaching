# Master Service Description

## Who I Am

I'm Rustam Babadjanov. I started coding at 16 as a freelance web developer in Uzbekistan, and since then I've worn most of the hats that exist in tech companies: software engineer, senior engineer, lead product manager, engineering manager.

I co-founded YamFood in 2019—bootstrapped it with $20K, pivoted from B2C to B2B logistics when the market told us to. Later, at Express24 (which was acquired by Yandex), I helped build a product that reached 100K+ monthly active users and $50M in annual revenue. I established data-driven culture and OKRs as Lead PM. As an engineer, I optimized systems that couldn't afford to break. As an engineering manager, I led cross-functional teams through the complexity of fast growth.

I've been inside the chaos. The decisions that keep you up at 3am. The patterns you can see but can't seem to change. The loneliness that comes with being responsible for everything while having no one you can be fully honest with.

Today, I coach leaders. I've had a private coaching practice since 2024 and am currently completing my ICF accreditation (started 2025, completing 2026). My approach is shaped by two Vipassana meditation courses, training in communications and coaching talk, and deep study of modalities that actually create lasting change.

I'm also building Growy AI—a platform for team alignment and organizational growth. I stay close to the startup world not just as a coach, but as someone still building.

**Languages:** English and Russian
**Geography:** Global (virtual sessions)

## What I Offer

### Format

- **1:1 coaching sessions** — 60 minutes each
- **Engagement length** — typically 3-6 months
- **Session approach** — we work with what you bring. Each session explores your current challenges, decisions, and patterns. There's no fixed curriculum—because what matters most to you right now is where the real work happens.

### Methodology

My approach blends several modalities, integrated in a way that serves practical transformation:

**ICF Core Coaching Competencies**
The foundation: active listening, powerful questions, direct communication, partnership. The structure that creates space for you to think clearly and find your own answers.

**Somatic Modalities (Body-Based Awareness)**
Patterns don't just live in your head. Stress, avoidance, reactivity—they show up in your body before your mind catches up. We use body awareness to access insights that thinking alone can't reach.

**Internal Family Systems (IFS/Parts Work)**
You're not one thing. There's a part of you that wants to take the risk, and a part that's terrified. A part that's ambitious, and a part that says you don't deserve it. Instead of fighting these parts, we learn to understand them. That's where real change begins.

**Vipassana Meditation Practice**
My foundation. Not something I teach, but something that shapes how I hold space. Equanimity, presence, the capacity to sit with discomfort without rushing to fix it.

This blend means we can move from practical decision-making to deeper pattern work in the same session—whatever serves you best.

## Who This Is For

### The People I Serve

**Ambitious professionals who are ready to grow.**

You've achieved real things. You're not broken, not in crisis, not looking for therapy. But you know there's a next level—in your leadership, in how you show up, in who you're becoming—and you want support getting there.

You might be:
- A **startup founder** navigating the loneliness and high-stakes decisions that come with building something
- A **leader in transition**—stepping into a bigger role, changing companies, or figuring out what's next
- Someone facing **leadership challenges**—managing people, handling conflict, communicating with stakeholders who don't think like you
- Someone stuck in **patterns**—you can see them, you know they're costing you, but you haven't been able to change them alone
- Someone dealing with **inner blocks**—imposter syndrome, self-doubt, the voice that says you don't belong or can't handle it
- Someone making **high-stakes decisions** in uncertain conditions, wanting a thinking partner who has no agenda

### Who This Isn't For

- People in acute crisis who need clinical support (therapy is the right choice)
- People looking for someone to tell them what to do (mentors and advisors are better for that)
- People who want quick fixes or life hacks (transformation takes time and commitment)

---

## The Transformation

### Where You Start

**Externally, things look fine.** You've built something real—a company, a career, a reputation. You're capable, driven, accomplished.

**Internally, it's more complicated:**

- Decisions pile up because you can't think through them clearly, or you're afraid of being wrong
- The same patterns keep showing up—in relationships, in how you lead, in how you react under stress—and you can see them but can't seem to stop them
- There's a gap between how you show up and who you want to be
- You feel alone with the hard stuff—the fears, the doubts, the questions you can't ask anyone
- You're performing "strong" or "capable" when inside you feel like a fraud
- You sense there's a next level, but you don't know how to reach it

### What Becomes Possible

**Clarity.** The decision you've been avoiding? You'll see it clearly, with your blind spots visible, and make a choice you can stand behind.

**Changed patterns.** The behaviors that keep costing you—relationships, opportunities, peace of mind—you'll understand why they exist and find a new way.

**Owned decisions.** Not advice-driven choices you second-guess, but decisions that feel truly yours. You'll stop waiting for permission and start trusting yourself.

**Presence.** The capacity to stay calm when things are hard. To sit with uncertainty without being consumed by it. To lead from groundedness instead of reactivity.

**Not being alone.** Someone who knows who you really are—beyond the role, beyond the performance—and holds that with complete confidentiality and zero judgment.

**Growth.** Becoming the leader you need to be for what's next—without losing yourself in the process.

## Why Me vs. Alternatives

### vs. Mentor or Advisor

Mentors give you their answer from their experience with their biases. Advisors often have a stake—they want outcomes that benefit them. You get advice, and advice is useful, but it's not thinking space. And you can't be fully honest with them about fears or doubts—they're evaluating whether you're "leadership material."

**Coaching gives you your answer**, uncovered through questions, reflection, and challenge—an answer you can own because it came from you.

### vs. Therapist

Therapy is designed to take you from "not okay" to "okay." It addresses pathology, trauma, dysfunction. It's important work, and if that's what you need, therapy is the right choice.

**This work is "okay" to "awesome."** You're already functioning, already successful. We're working on evolution, not repair. Transformation without treating you as broken.

### vs. Friends, Partner, or Co-founder

They're too close. They have stakes in your decisions and emotional investment in certain outcomes. You can't say "I'm afraid I can't handle this" without consequences—scaring them, damaging the relationship, losing credibility.

**I have zero stake in your decisions.** Complete confidentiality. Nothing you say will be used against you, shared with anyone, or change how I see you.

### vs. Other Coaches

Many business coaches stay surface-level—tactics, tips, frameworks. Many "transformational" coaches are abstract and slow—years of work before anything changes.

**I integrate both.** The depth of real modalities (IFS, somatic work, developmental theory) with the pragmatism of someone who's actually built things. Grounded in firsthand tech and startup experience, not just theory.

---

## How to Start

### The Path to Working Together

**1. Free Intro Session (60 minutes)**
Bring something real—a decision you're stuck on, a pattern you want to understand, a situation you're navigating. You'll get a taste of how this works and clarity on whatever you bring. No sales pitch. Whether we continue or not, you'll walk away with something useful.

**2. If There's a Fit**
We'll discuss engagement structure, logistics, and get started. Typically we begin with sessions every two weeks, adjusting based on what's happening in your life and work.

**3. The Work**
Each session, you bring what's alive for you. We go wherever it needs to go—practical decisions, deeper patterns, both. Over time, you'll notice shifts. Decisions get clearer. Old patterns loosen. You start showing up differently—not through effort, but because something has actually changed.

# Startup Founders Version

## Transformational Coaching for Founders

*For founders at 5-100 people*

### The Reality Nobody Talks About

72% of founders face mental health challenges. Only 7% get support.

You're not looking for therapy. You're not broken. But you know what it's like to:

- Have a critical decision sitting in your head for weeks because you can't think through it clearly—and there's no one to discuss it with as equals
- Lose your third key hire to the same dynamic and realize the pattern is you
- Get feedback that you're micromanaging, knowing they're right but not knowing how to change it
- Lie awake wondering if you can actually handle what's coming—the Series B, the scaling, the leadership the company needs
- Start telling someone what you're really going through... and stop mid-sentence because they don't get it

You have a team, investors, maybe a co-founder, maybe a partner. And you're completely alone with the hard stuff.

---

### What You Get

**A thinking partner who understands startup context—with zero stake in your decisions.**

**Structured thinking when chaos hits.**
Fire the co-founder? Pivot or persevere? Take the term sheet on bad terms? The decision you've been procrastinating for three weeks? We turn chaos into clear problems, surface your blind spots, and help you make decisions you can actually own—not advice-driven choices you'll second-guess tomorrow.

**Patterns changed—without years of therapy.**
Lost your third key hire to the same dynamic? Micromanaging when you know you shouldn't? Avoiding the conflict that's killing momentum? We see the pattern, understand what it's protecting, and find a new way. Practical transformation, not treatment.

**A space to be honest when you can't be anywhere else.**
"I'm afraid I won't handle the Series B." "I'm not sure I deserve this valuation." "I can't stop beating myself up when things go wrong." The things you can't tell team, board, investors, or partner. Said, heard, not used against you.

---

### Who I Am

I've been where you are. I co-founded YamFood—bootstrapped $20K, pivoted from B2C to B2B logistics. At Express24 (acquired by Yandex), I helped build a product that reached 100K+ MAU and $50M in annual revenue. I've been the one making decisions alone at 3am, losing people to patterns I couldn't see until someone helped me look.

I do this work because I know what it's like to have no one you can be fully honest with at the top. And I've seen how much changes when you finally do—for you, your team, and what you're building.

My approach blends ICF core coaching competencies, somatic modalities, Internal Family Systems, and a foundation in Vipassana meditation practice. The depth of real transformation modalities with the pragmatism founders need.

---

### The Transformation

**What You'll Feel:**
- **Worthy of your success** — not "I got lucky" but "I earned this"
- **Calm in uncertainty** — decisions made clearly, not after weeks of agonizing
- **Free to be yourself** — not performing "strong CEO" 24/7
- **Not alone** — someone knows who you really are, completely

**What Changes (Measurably):**
- **Decision quality** — faster choices, owned fully, minimal regret
- **Team retention** — patterns that caused turnover? Changed.
- **You're not the bottleneck** — company scales, you evolve with it
- **Leadership presence** — 360 feedback improves, team trust increases

---

### The Format

- **60-minute sessions**, typically every two weeks
- **3-6 month engagements** — enough time for real transformation
- **We work with what you bring** — no fixed curriculum, just what matters most right now
- **Complete confidentiality** — nothing leaves the session, ever

---

### Why This, Not Something Else

**vs. Mentor or Advisor**
They give you their answer. Their biases. Sometimes their agenda. You can't be fully honest about fears or doubts—they're judging if you're "CEO material." I give you your answer, found through your own thinking with my support.

**vs. Therapist**
Therapy is "not okay → okay." You're not broken—you're already successful and want the next level. This is "okay → awesome": transformation without pathology.

**vs. Co-founder, partner, or friend**
They're too close. You can't say "I'm afraid I won't handle the Series B" without consequences. I have zero stake. Nothing you say changes how I see you.

---

### Start Here

**Free 60-minute intro session.**

Bring a real decision you're stuck on or a pattern you want to change. You'll walk away with clarity and a feel for how this works—whether we continue or not.

No sales pitch. No pressure. Just a sample of what it's like to think with someone who understands startup context and has no agenda in your decisions.

# Ambitious Professionals Version

## Coaching for Leaders Ready to Grow

*Become the leader you're meant to be*

### You've Achieved Real Things

Your career is working. You've built something—skills, reputation, results. From the outside, you're succeeding.

But inside, there's something else:

- A sense that there's a next level you can't quite reach
- Patterns that keep showing up—in how you lead, how you communicate, how you handle conflict—that you can see but can't seem to change
- Transitions you're navigating—a new role, a bigger scope, a shift in what you want—without a clear map
- Inner voices that question whether you belong, whether you can handle it, whether you've just been lucky
- The loneliness of leadership—people around you who depend on you, but no one you can be fully honest with

You're not looking for therapy. You're not broken. But you know there's work to do—on who you're becoming, not just what you're accomplishing.

---

### What This Is

**A space for the growth you can't do alone.**

Most development happens at the surface: skills, tactics, frameworks. Useful, but it doesn't touch the real stuff—the patterns, the beliefs, the fears that actually drive how you show up.

This work goes deeper. Through 1:1 coaching sessions, we explore what's really happening for you:

**Clarity in complexity.**
When everything feels tangled, we untangle it. The decision you're avoiding becomes clear. The problem you couldn't articulate gets named. You find your own answer—one you can actually own.

**Patterns understood and changed.**
That recurring conflict with authority. The way you shut down under stress. The tendency to over-function when you should delegate. We see the pattern, understand what it's protecting, and find a new way.

**Inner blocks worked through.**
Imposter syndrome. Self-doubt. The voice that says you're not ready. These aren't weaknesses to overcome—they're parts of you that need to be understood. When we work with them, not against them, something shifts.

**The space to be honest.**
With me, you can say the things you can't say elsewhere. The fears. The doubts. The questions that would undermine you if spoken aloud. Said, heard, held—without judgment or agenda.

---

### Who I Am

I'm Rustam Babadjanov. I've worked across roles in tech—engineer, product lead, engineering manager, co-founder—at companies from early-stage startups to a $50M revenue business acquired by Yandex. I know what it's like to lead under pressure, to make decisions with incomplete information, to carry responsibility for things you can't fully control.

I've been coaching since 2024 and am completing my ICF accreditation in 2026. My approach integrates ICF core competencies with somatic modalities (body-based awareness), Internal Family Systems (parts work), and a foundation in Vipassana meditation practice.

This blend matters because change that lasts doesn't just come from talking about things differently. It comes from understanding how patterns live in your body, how different parts of you have different needs, and how to create the inner conditions for transformation.

I work globally, virtually, in English and Russian.

---

### What Becomes Possible

**For yourself:**
- Confidence that comes from inside, not from external validation
- Calm in uncertainty—the capacity to lead through complexity without being consumed by it
- Freedom from old patterns that have been running you
- Peace with the parts of yourself you've been fighting
- Not being alone with the hard stuff

**For your leadership:**
- Clearer decisions, made faster, owned fully
- Better relationships—less conflict, more trust, easier communication
- Teams that follow you because of who you are, not just your title
- The capacity to grow as your scope grows, without burning out

---

### The Format

- **60-minute 1:1 sessions**, typically every two weeks
- **3-6 months** is the typical engagement—long enough for real transformation
- **No fixed curriculum**—we work with what you bring, going wherever it needs to go
- **Virtual sessions**, flexible scheduling

---

### Why This, Not Something Else

**vs. Mentors or Advisors**
They give you their answers based on their experience. Useful for tactical questions, but it's not thinking space, and you can't be fully honest about your doubts. This work helps you find your own answers.

**vs. Therapy**
Therapy is for healing what's broken. This is for growth when you're already whole. "Okay → awesome," not "not okay → okay."

**vs. Leadership Programs**
Programs teach frameworks. This work changes patterns. Knowledge isn't usually the problem—implementation is. We work on the inner stuff that makes outer change possible.

**vs. Going It Alone**
You've probably been trying. How's it going? The patterns you can see but can't change exist for a reason. Sometimes you need someone outside your own system to help you shift.

---

### Start Here

**A free 60-minute session.**

Bring something real—a transition you're navigating, a pattern you keep noticing, a challenge you're facing. We'll work with it together, and you'll get a taste of what this approach feels like.

No sales pitch. Just a conversation that will give you something useful, whether we continue or not.

# Key Messaging Blocks

*Modular content for different contexts—social media, emails, website sections, etc.*

---

## One-Liners

**For founders:**
- "A thinking partner for the decisions you can't discuss with anyone else."
- "Patterns changed, decisions owned, loneliness ended—without years of therapy."
- "72% of founders face mental health challenges. Only 7% get support. You don't need therapy—you need evolution."
- "No agenda. No stake in your decisions."

**For broader audience:**
- "Become the leader you're meant to be."
- "Growth that goes deeper than frameworks and tactics."
- "For ambitious professionals ready to transform, not just perform."
- "The work that makes outer change possible."

---

## Core Value Propositions

### For Founders

**Decision Clarity**
Turn chaos into clear problems. See your blind spots. Make decisions you can own—not advice you'll second-guess tomorrow.

**Pattern Transformation**
The behaviors that keep costing you people, opportunities, and peace of mind? We understand why they exist and change them—in months, not years.

**Safe Space**
The things you can't tell team, board, investors, or partner. Said, heard, held—with complete confidentiality and zero judgment.

### For All Professionals

**Growth Beyond Surface**
Most development touches skills. This work touches patterns, beliefs, and who you're becoming.

**Your Own Answers**
Not advice-driven. Not someone else's playbook. Clarity you uncover yourself—answers you can truly own.

**Not Alone**
Someone who knows who you really are, beyond the role. Complete confidentiality. Zero agenda.

---

## Differentiators

**Why me specifically:**
- **Firsthand experience**: Built companies, led teams, made high-stakes decisions—not just studied them
- **Rare blend**: Technical credibility + depth modalities (IFS, somatic, contemplative)—most coaches have one or the other
- **No agenda**: I don't invest in founders, consult for companies, or have any stake in your decisions
- **Okay → Awesome**: We work from strength, not pathology. You're not broken; you're evolving.

---

## Objection Handling Blocks

**"I should handle this myself."**
The higher you go, the fewer people you can be honest with. Having a thinking partner isn't weakness—it's the structure that lets you operate at the next level. Every elite athlete, every top CEO has a coach. Not because they're weak—because performance at this level requires it.

**"What if information leaks?"**
Complete confidentiality. Zero connections to your investors, board, or competitors. Everything said in sessions stays there—ever. This is the foundation. Without it, nothing works.

**"I don't have time."**
Two sessions per month—less than 1% of your working hours. The decision you've been avoiding for three weeks? Resolved in one session. The pattern that cost you your third key hire? Worth a few hours to fix. This multiplies your effectiveness; it doesn't drain your time.

**"Is this woo-woo or just another coach?"**
Fair skepticism. My approach integrates depth modalities (IFS, somatic work, developmental theory) with the pragmatism of someone who's actually built things. Research-backed. Measurable outcomes. Real transformation—not fluff.

---

## CTA Blocks

**Standard:**
Book a free 60-minute intro session. Bring something real—a decision, a pattern, a situation you're navigating. You'll walk away with clarity, whether we continue or not.

**Founder-specific:**
Bring a real decision you're stuck on or a pattern you want to change. No sales pitch. No pressure. Just a sample of what it's like to think with someone who understands startup context and has no stake in your decisions.

**Softer/Curious:**
A free conversation to explore whether this could help. No commitment. Just see what it's like.
