# Master Service Description

## Who I Am

I believe the best coaching happens when two people go deep together — not as guru and client, but as partners. I bring curiosity, directness, and a willingness to sit in the uncomfortable places where real change lives.

Every session is an experiment. We might work with a decision that's keeping you up at night, or go underneath it into the patterns and parts driving it. I follow what's alive, not a script.

I come from the world I coach in. I co-founded a startup, built products at a company acquired by Yandex, and led teams through the chaos of fast growth. I know what it's like to carry the weight of decisions with nobody to be honest with.

I've been coaching since 2024 and I'm completing my ICF accreditation in 2026. My approach draws on formal coaching training, somatic work, Internal Family Systems, and years of meditation and internal work. I'm also building ttune.ai — I'm still in the startup world, not coaching from the outside.

**Languages:** English and Russian
**Geography:** Global (virtual sessions worldwide)

## What I Offer

### Format

- **1:1 coaching sessions** — 60 minutes each
- **Session frequency** — every week, adjusted to what's happening in your life
- **Engagement length** — typically 3-6 months
- **No curriculum** — you bring what's on your mind. The stuff that matters to you right now is where the work happens.

### How I Work

We work with whatever you bring. Sometimes that's a concrete decision you need to make this week. Sometimes it goes deeper — into the patterns and beliefs underneath. I draw from several approaches to go wherever the session needs to go:

**ICF coaching fundamentals**
Listening, asking questions, creating space for you to think clearly and find your own answers.

**Body awareness**
Patterns show up in your body before your mind catches up. Sometimes we need to go there.

**Parts work (IFS)**
Understanding the competing voices inside you instead of fighting them.

**Meditation Practice**
Shapes how I show up: the ability to sit with discomfort without rushing to fix it.

## Who This Is For

### Ready to Go Deeper

You're accomplished and capable. You don't need fixing — you want partnership. Someone to think with, experiment with, and go beneath the surface with. Because the next level isn't about working harder. It's about seeing clearer.

You might be:
- A **founder** dealing with the loneliness and the weight of decisions nobody else can make
- A **leader in transition**, stepping into a bigger role or figuring out what's next
- Someone struggling with **people stuff**: managing, conflict, communicating with stakeholders who don't think like you
- Someone stuck in **patterns** you can see but can't seem to stop
- Someone dealing with **imposter syndrome**, self-doubt, the voice that says you don't belong
- Someone making **hard calls** with incomplete information, wanting a thinking partner who doesn't have a stake in your decision

### Not a Fit If:

- You're in crisis and need clinical support. That's what therapy is for.
- You want someone to tell you what to do. Get a mentor or advisor.
- You want quick fixes. This takes time.

## Why Coaching, Not Something Else

### vs. Mentor or Advisor

They give you their answer, from their experience, with their biases. You can't be fully honest about fears or doubts — they're evaluating whether you're "leadership material."

**Coaching gives you your answer** — uncovered through questions and challenge. An answer you own because it came from you.

### vs. Therapist

Therapy takes you from "not okay" to "okay." Important work, and if that's what you need, do that.

**This is "okay" to "next level."** You're already functioning. We're working on evolution, not repair.

### vs. Friends, Partner, or Co-founder

They're too close. They have stakes in your decisions. You can't say "I'm afraid I can't handle this" without consequences.

**I have zero stake in your decisions.** Complete confidentiality. Nothing you say will be shared with anyone or used against you.

### vs. Other Coaches

Many business coaches stay surface-level — tactics and frameworks. Many "transformational" coaches are abstract and slow.

**I integrate both.** Depth modalities with the pragmatism of someone who's actually built things in tech.

---

## How to Start

### A Real Session, Not a Sales Call

**1. Free First Session (60 minutes)**
Bring something real: a decision you're stuck on, a pattern you want to understand, a situation you're navigating. This isn't a pitch. It's actual coaching. You'll leave with clarity on whatever you bring, whether we continue or not.

**2. If It's a Fit**
We figure out logistics and get started. Usually every week, adjusted based on what's going on in your life.

**3. The Work**
Each session, you bring what's on your mind. We go where it needs to go. Over time, things shift. Decisions get clearer. Old patterns loosen. You start showing up differently — not through willpower, but because something has actually changed.

# Startup Founders Version

## Coaching for Those Who Build

*For founders at 5-100 people*

### The Reality Nobody Talks About

72% of founders face mental health challenges. Only 7% get support.

You're not looking for therapy. You're not broken. But you know what it's like to:

- Have a critical decision sitting in your head for weeks because you can't think through it clearly—and there's no one to discuss it with as equals
- Lose your third key hire to the same dynamic and realize the pattern is you
- Get feedback that you're micromanaging, knowing they're right but not knowing how to change it
- Lie awake wondering if you can actually handle what's coming—the Series B, the scaling, the leadership the company needs
- Start telling someone what you're really going through... and stop mid-sentence because they don't get it

You have a team, investors, maybe a co-founder, maybe a partner. And you're completely alone with the hard stuff.

---

### What You Get

**A thinking partner who understands startup context—with zero stake in your decisions.**

**Structured thinking when chaos hits.**
Fire the co-founder? Pivot or persevere? Take the term sheet on bad terms? The decision you've been procrastinating for three weeks? We turn chaos into clear problems, surface your blind spots, and help you make decisions you can actually own—not advice-driven choices you'll second-guess tomorrow.

**Patterns changed—without years of therapy.**
Lost your third key hire to the same dynamic? Micromanaging when you know you shouldn't? Avoiding the conflict that's killing momentum? We see the pattern, understand what it's protecting, and find a new way. Practical transformation, not treatment.

**A space to be honest when you can't be anywhere else.**
"I'm afraid I won't handle the Series B." "I'm not sure I deserve this valuation." "I can't stop beating myself up when things go wrong." The things you can't tell team, board, investors, or partner. Said, heard, not used against you.

---

### Who I Am

I come from the world I coach in. I co-founded a startup, built products at a company acquired by Yandex, and led teams through the chaos of fast growth. I've been the one making decisions alone at 3am, losing people to patterns I couldn't see until someone helped me look.

I do this work because I know what it's like to have no one you can be fully honest with at the top. And I've seen how much changes when you finally do—for you, your team, and what you're building.

My approach draws on formal coaching training, somatic work, Internal Family Systems, and years of meditation and internal work. Depth modalities with the pragmatism founders need.

---

### The Transformation

**What You'll Feel:**
- **Worthy of your success** — not "I got lucky" but "I earned this"
- **Calm in uncertainty** — decisions made clearly, not after weeks of agonizing
- **Free to be yourself** — not performing "strong CEO" 24/7
- **Not alone** — someone knows who you really are, completely

**What Changes (Measurably):**
- **Decision quality** — faster choices, owned fully, minimal regret
- **Team retention** — patterns that caused turnover? Changed.
- **You're not the bottleneck** — company scales, you evolve with it
- **Leadership presence** — 360 feedback improves, team trust increases

---

### The Format

- **60-minute sessions**, every week, adjusted to what's happening
- **3-6 month engagements** — enough time for real transformation
- **No curriculum** — you bring what's on your mind, that's where the work happens
- **Complete confidentiality** — nothing leaves the session, ever

---

### Why This, Not Something Else

**vs. Mentor or Advisor**
They give you their answer, from their experience, with their biases. You can't be fully honest about fears or doubts—they're evaluating whether you're "leadership material." Coaching gives you your answer, found through your own thinking with my support.

**vs. Therapist**
Therapy takes you from "not okay" to "okay." You're not broken—you're already successful and want the next level. This is "okay" to "next level": evolution, not repair.

**vs. Co-founder, partner, or friend**
They're too close. You can't say "I'm afraid I won't handle the Series B" without consequences. I have zero stake. Nothing you say changes how I see you.

---

### Start Here

**A real session, not a sales call.**

60 minutes. Bring something real: a decision you're stuck on, a pattern you want to understand, a situation you're navigating. You'll leave with clarity on whatever you bring, whether we continue or not.

No sales pitch. No pressure. Just a sample of what it's like to think with someone who understands startup context and has no agenda in your decisions.

# Ambitious Professionals Version

## Coaching for Those Who Build

*A space to go deep with someone who gets it*

### You've Achieved Real Things

You're accomplished and capable. You don't need fixing — you want partnership. Someone to think with, experiment with, and go beneath the surface with. Because the next level isn't about working harder. It's about seeing clearer.

But inside, there's something else:

- A sense that there's a next level you can't quite reach
- Patterns that keep showing up—in how you lead, how you communicate, how you handle conflict—that you can see but can't seem to stop
- Transitions you're navigating—a new role, a bigger scope, a shift in what you want—without a clear map
- Inner voices that question whether you belong, whether you can handle it, whether you've just been lucky
- The loneliness of leadership—people around you who depend on you, but no one you can be fully honest with

You're not looking for therapy. You're not broken. But you know there's work to do—on who you're becoming, not just what you're accomplishing.

---

### What This Is

**A space to go deep with someone who gets it.**

We work as partners — exploring what's really going on, running experiments, and finding what actually shifts things. No agenda, no advice. Just the kind of honest work that changes how you lead and live.

Through 1:1 coaching sessions, we explore what's really happening for you:

**Clarity in complexity.**
When everything feels tangled, we untangle it. The decision you're avoiding becomes clear. The problem you couldn't articulate gets named. You find your own answer—one you can actually own.

**Patterns understood and changed.**
That recurring conflict with authority. The way you shut down under stress. The tendency to over-function when you should delegate. We see the pattern, understand what it's protecting, and find a new way.

**Inner blocks worked through.**
Imposter syndrome. Self-doubt. The voice that says you're not ready. These aren't weaknesses to overcome—they're parts of you that need to be understood. When we work with them, not against them, something shifts.

**The space to be honest.**
With me, you can say the things you can't say elsewhere. The fears. The doubts. The questions that would undermine you if spoken aloud. Said, heard, held—without judgment or agenda.

### What Becomes Possible

**For yourself:**
- Confidence that comes from inside, not from external validation
- Calm in uncertainty—the capacity to lead through complexity without being consumed by it
- Freedom from old patterns that have been running you
- Peace with the parts of yourself you've been fighting
- Not being alone with the hard stuff

**For your leadership:**
- Clearer decisions, made faster, owned fully
- Better relationships—less conflict, more trust, easier communication
- Teams that follow you because of who you are, not just your title
- The capacity to grow as your scope grows, without burning out

---

### The Format

- **60-minute 1:1 sessions**, every week, adjusted to what's happening
- **3-6 months** is the typical engagement—long enough for real transformation
- **No curriculum**—you bring what's on your mind, that's where the work happens
- **Virtual sessions**, flexible scheduling

---

### Why This, Not Something Else

**vs. Mentors or Advisors**
They give you their answers based on their experience. Useful for tactical questions, but it's not thinking space, and you can't be fully honest about your doubts. This work helps you find your own answers.

**vs. Therapy**
Therapy is for healing what's broken. This is for growth when you're already whole. "Okay → next level," not "not okay → okay."

**vs. Leadership Programs**
Programs teach frameworks. This work changes patterns. Knowledge isn't usually the problem—implementation is. We work on the inner stuff that makes outer change possible.

**vs. Going It Alone**
You've probably been trying. How's it going? The patterns you can see but can't change exist for a reason. Sometimes you need someone outside your own system to help you shift.

---

### Start Here

**A real session, not a sales call.**

60 minutes. Bring something real—a transition you're navigating, a pattern you keep noticing, a challenge you're facing. We'll work with it together, and you'll get a taste of what this approach feels like.

No sales pitch. Just a conversation that will give you something useful, whether we continue or not.

# Key Messaging Blocks

*Modular content for different contexts—social media, emails, website sections, etc.*

---

## One-Liners

**For founders:**
- "A thinking partner for the decisions you can't discuss with anyone else."
- "Patterns changed, decisions owned, loneliness ended—without years of therapy."
- "72% of founders face mental health challenges. Only 7% get support. You don't need therapy—you need evolution."
- "No agenda. No stake in your decisions."

**For broader audience:**
- "Coaching for Those Who Build."

- "For ambitious professionals ready to transform, not just perform."
- "No agenda, no advice. Just the kind of honest work that changes how you lead and live."

---

## Core Value Propositions

### For Founders

**Decision Clarity**
Turn chaos into clear problems. See your blind spots. Make decisions you can own—not advice you'll second-guess tomorrow.

**Pattern Transformation**
The behaviors that keep costing you people, opportunities, and peace of mind? We understand why they exist and change them—in months, not years.

**Safe Space**
The things you can't tell team, board, investors, or partner. Said, heard, held—with complete confidentiality and zero judgment.

### For All Professionals

**Partnership, Not Guru**
Not advice-driven. Not someone else's playbook. Two people going deep together as partners—exploring, experimenting, finding what shifts things.

**Your Own Answers**
Clarity you uncover yourself—answers you can truly own. No agenda, no stake in your decisions.

**Not Alone**
Someone who knows who you really are, beyond the role. Complete confidentiality. Zero agenda.

---

## Differentiators

**Why me specifically:**
- **From the world I coach in**: Co-founded a startup, built products at a company acquired by Yandex, led teams through fast growth—not just studied them
- **Still building**: Currently building ttune.ai—still in the startup world, not coaching from the outside
- **Rare blend**: Formal coaching training + depth modalities (IFS, somatic work, meditation practice)—most coaches have one or the other
- **No agenda**: I don't invest in founders, consult for companies, or have any stake in your decisions
- **Partnership model**: Not guru and client. Two people going deep together.

---

## Objection Handling Blocks

**"I should handle this myself."**
The higher you go, the fewer people you can be honest with. Having a thinking partner isn't weakness—it's the structure that lets you operate at the next level. Every elite athlete, every top CEO has a coach. Not because they're weak—because performance at this level requires it.

**"What if information leaks?"**
Complete confidentiality. Zero connections to your investors, board, or competitors. Everything said in sessions stays there—ever. This is the foundation. Without it, nothing works.

**"I don't have time."**
One session per week—the decision you've been avoiding for three weeks? Resolved in one session. The pattern that cost you your third key hire? Worth a few hours to fix. This multiplies your effectiveness; it doesn't drain your time.

**"Is this woo-woo or just another coach?"**
Fair skepticism. My approach draws on formal coaching training, somatic work, Internal Family Systems, and meditation practice—integrated with the pragmatism of someone who's actually built things. Real transformation, grounded in experience.

---

## CTA Blocks

**Standard:**
Book a free first session. 60 minutes. Bring something real: a decision, a pattern, a situation you're navigating. This isn't a pitch—it's actual coaching. You'll leave with clarity, whether we continue or not.

**Founder-specific:**
Bring a real decision you're stuck on or a pattern you want to change. No sales pitch. No pressure. Just a sample of what it's like to think with someone who understands startup context and has no stake in your decisions.

**Softer/Curious:**
A free conversation to explore whether this could help. No commitment. Just see what it's like.
